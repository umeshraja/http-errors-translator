# Multilingual Http Erorr Messages
Http error messages in different languages for end user.

Idea: To provide standard set of http messages for all applications that end users can easily understand.
> This idea came into my mind when i was working
> at my company and different frontend applications
> were using different error messages for same issue.
> In order to provide consistency across applications,
> i have implemented this library that provides similar
> set of error messages in multiple languages. During
> first release, only English Language is supported.
> In subsequent releases, messages in other languages will be available. This repository is public, anyone can contribute
> to add error messages in their native language.
